# Project Overview
- Task Creation: Users can create tasks which will be stored in a MongoDB database.
- 
- User Authentication: Implement a system where users can sign up, log in, and their tasks will be associated with their specific accounts.

# ToDo
- Middleware: This could be a central piece of code that intercepts requests to the server, allowing you to implement authentication checks, validation, or other necessary operations before the request reaches the intended endpoint.

- Delete Task: Users should have the ability to delete tasks they have created.

- Populate Task with User: Associating tasks with the user who created them, likely via user IDs or some form of authentication token to ensure privacy and ownership.
